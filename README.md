# 🔐 Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository.

This repository documents my learning journey as an **Information Security Engineering student**, where I collect notes, scripts, and practical labs related to **Cybersecurity, Networking, Linux, and Ethical Hacking**.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a strong foundation in cybersecurity concepts
- Practice hands-on security scripting and labs
- Track my progress from beginner to professional level
- Create a public portfolio for future internships and job opportunities
